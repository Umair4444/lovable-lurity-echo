          In marketing, people often debate creativity, budget, frequency,
          targeting.

          Digital out-of-home (DOOH) has one big advantage: it plays in the real
          world, where people naturally spend money. And that's exactly why
          choosing the right screen is absolutely crucial. The right placement
          can lift campaign results by 20–30%. In some cases even more.

          1. Location = context. And context sells.

          And a screen is not just a screen.

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The difference between "they saw it" and "they bought it" lies in the

          Example from the world: Coca-Cola – proximity campaigns
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Coca-Cola has been using DOOH for years in places of immediate
          consumption — in front of supermarkets, near food courts, at gas
          stations, in pedestrian zones.

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4 font-semibold">
          The result?
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Campaigns running in close proximity to the point of purchase perform
          28–32% better than generic brand placements (data from{" "}
          <em>Globally Storytelling for OOH</em>, JCDecaux and Coca-Cola
          European Partners).

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Not because the visual is different.

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
          But because the person is already in a buying mindset.

        <h2 className="article-h2">2. Hyperlocal data changes the game</h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Ten years ago, OOH was bought based on intuition.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Today it's bought based on pedestrian routes, dwell time, proximity to
          points of interest, and the daily rhythm of a city.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4 font-semibold">
          What does the brand gain?
        </p>

        <ul className="article-list">
          <li>ads placed where the probability of purchase is truly high</li>
          <li>an audience that has the right buying mindset and intent</li>
          <li>
            effectiveness you can't get online (no scrolling, no skipping)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4 font-semibold">
          Example from the world: McDonald's
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          McDonald's has long used "wayfinding" OOH — screens at exits,
          underpasses, pedestrian flows, near food courts.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Precise targeting on routes with the highest footfall brings
          double-digit increases in visits, while some campaigns (UK, DE) report
          a 20–25% increase in sales of the promoted products.

          3. The biggest mistake brands make: they buy screens, not people's
          movement
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          This is the weak point of many OOH and DOOH campaigns — they choose
          "nice screens," not the ones where people actually are and make
          purchases.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4 font-semibold">
          What does a good location selection bring?
        </p>

        <ul className="article-list">
          <li>reach among people who can physically buy</li>
          <li>higher attention (high dwell time = longer viewing)</li>
          <li>lower media waste</li>
          <li>immediate impact on revenue</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4 font-semibold">
          Example from the world: Tesco – impulsive decisions
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Tesco UK tested DOOH at store entrances vs. random city locations.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The difference in sales was +18% for screens placed at the last step
          before entering the store.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
          That's exactly the moment when advertising works as a "psychological
          trigger."

          4. How to get the most out of it in practice (including on Lurity
          screens)
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4 font-semibold">
          a) Plan the campaign according to the customer's route
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Brands that think this way achieve the strongest results:
        </p>

        <ul className="article-list">
          <li>How does the person move?</li>
          <li>Where do they decide?</li>
          <li>Where do they spend?</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Choose screens based on the campaign goal, not random "top locations."
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4 font-semibold">
          b) Consider the consumer's purchasing rhythm
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Pre-Christmas sales a few weeks before Christmas work psychologically
          differently than a few days before Christmas or right after. With us,
          you can change creatives anytime without any fees — exactly according
          to consumer psychology.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4 font-semibold">
          c) For retail campaigns, proximity is the most important principle
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The ad must be close to the purchase.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Literally: a few meters from the place where the decision is made.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4 font-semibold">
          d) Use short, clear creative
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
          A few seconds of audience attention = a short and direct message,
          contrast, large typography, large product, strong call to action.
        </p>

        <h2 className="article-h2">5. Why does all of this work?</h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Very simply — because out-of-home is the medium of the final impulse.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Online, people ignore banners.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          But in the city, the ad catches them exactly where they are already
          acting.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          That's the main reason why the right location makes the difference
          between:
        </p>

        <ul className="article-list">
          <li>a "nice" campaign</li>
          <li>and a campaign that actually increases sales</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="article-h2">
          Final summary: Location is 80% of DOOH campaign success
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          When brands invest in creativity and media but ignore location
          selection, they lose the biggest potential of their campaign.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Whether you're doing retail, fast food, FMCG, or services — if you hit
          the moment and the place, you hit the results.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          And this is exactly why we at Lurity invest in:
        </p>

        <ul className="article-list">
          <li>strong locations in top shopping centers</li>
          <li>screens with the highest dwell time</li>
          <li>software where clients can see real statistics</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed">
          So if you want a functional and effective campaign, it's time to start
          seeing DOOH as a mandatory part of your media mix.
