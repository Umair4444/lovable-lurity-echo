          Digital out-of-home (DOOH) advertising – once sci-fi, now our everyday
          reality. We're standing by the road, waiting for the train, walking
          through a shopping mall – and the screens around us are moving,
          reacting, glowing... sometimes they even seem to know it's raining.
          That's DOOH. And more and more brands now see it as an essential part
          of their media strategy.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
          So why is that? Let's break it down into five key reasons – supported
          by real-world examples.
        </p>

        <h3 className="article-h3">
          1. Because it's where people are – and when they're ready to act
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Today's digital screens live in shopping malls, parking lots, public
          transit, gyms… Basically, wherever people are physically present and
          mentally open to interaction. That's a huge difference from banner ads
          that most users scroll past (if they even load them).
        </p>

          Did you know that 76% of people who saw a DOOH ad took some form of
          action? (Source: StackAdapt)
        </blockquote>

        <h3 className="article-h3">
          2. Because it's up-to-date – like your morning tweet
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Imagine a campaign that changes with the day. Morning: coffee deals.
          Afternoon: lunch offers. Or a countdown for your Black Friday sale, a
          weekend flash promo, or a real-time visual switch depending on the
          weather.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6 italic">
          McDonald's UK launched a campaign where chilled drinks only appeared
          on screens when the temperature rose above 22°C. It worked — and
          customers noticed.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
          Lurity allows clients to update visuals in minutes — no printing, no
          logistics, no delay.
        </p>

        <h3 className="article-h3">
          3. Because hyper-local targeting is a superpower
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          DOOH isn't about mass reach at all costs. Quite the opposite — the
          more precisely you can answer <em>who, where, and when</em>, the more
          effectively you can speak to your audience.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6 italic">
          Nulo, a pet food brand in the US, ran a DOOH campaign only within an 8
          km radius of their retail locations. The result? A +40% increase in
          brand awareness and a significant rise in in-store visits.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
          With Lurity, brands can pick exactly where to be visible — like only
          in Aupark Bratislava, only in Košice, or only in selected fitness
          clubs.
        </p>

        <h3 className="article-h3">
          4. Because it connects offline with online – and that synergy works
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          DOOH isn't just about the physical world anymore. It increasingly acts
          as a trigger for digital engagement. QR codes, geofencing, mobile ad
          pairing — all these help to create a seamless, cross-channel brand
          experience.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6 italic">
          Amazon Prime Video used 3D DOOH billboards in London and New York to
          promote a new series — people took pictures, shared them, searched for
          the trailer and boosted the campaign's reach organically.
        </p>

        <blockquote className="article-quote">
          When a DOOH ad includes a clear call-to-action, redirect link, or
          connects well with the online portion of a campaign, it becomes a
          powerful engagement driver.
        </blockquote>

        <h3 className="article-h3">
          5. Because campaign performance is transparent – it's way more than
          "just a pretty screen"
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          DOOH has moved far beyond "we hope people saw it." Today, performance
          can be tracked in real-time — impressions, foot traffic, timing,
          creative impact. Clients can immediately see what's working and adjust
          accordingly.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-6 italic">
          In a global Magnum campaign, DOOH was used across multiple cities with
          different creatives. Based on live results, the media spend was
          redirected toward high-performing locations. Flexibility + efficiency.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed mb-10">
          Platforms like Lurity provide real-time dashboards, giving clients
          full visibility into what's working — and what needs to change.
        </p>

        <h2 className="article-h2">
          DOOH is no longer "extra" — it's a must-have
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed">
          Digital OOH is now a full-fledged part of modern campaigns. It's not
          about "trying one billboard." It's about{" "}
          <strong>integrating it smartly</strong> with your online, mobile, PR,
          and social strategy. And when you get that mix right, DOOH delivers
          campaigns that don't just get noticed — they drive real results.
