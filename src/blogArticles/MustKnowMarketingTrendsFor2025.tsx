        The year 2025 is bringing dynamic changes to the world of marketing that
        are shaping new approaches to reaching customers. Key trends include the
        use of artificial intelligence (AI), content personalization,
        optimization for voice search, advanced use of digital out-of-home
        (DOOH) advertising, and the growing popularity of neuromarketing.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">
        1. Artificial intelligence and personalization: the revolution in
        marketing
      </h2>
      <p className="text-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        AI is becoming an integral part of marketing strategies.{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">
          According to Kantar's 2024 survey, 68% of marketers said AI has helped
          them better understand customer behavior and increase campaign
          effectiveness.
        </span>{" "}
        For example, e-commerce giant Amazon uses AI to personalize product
        recommendations, contributing to 35% of their overall sales.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">
        2. Optimization for voice search: voice as a new search tool
      </h2>
      <p className="text-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        With the rise in the use of voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa and
        Google Assistant, voice search is becoming a normal part of life.{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">
          By 2025, up to 50% of all online searches are expected to be conducted
          by voice.
        </span>{" "}
        This is forcing brands to optimize their content for conversational
        keywords and natural language to stay relevant.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">
        3. Digital Out of Home Advertising (DOOH): connecting digital with
        reality
      </h2>
      <p className="text-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Digital outdoor has boomed in recent years across the corona.{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">
          According to a report by Kantar, investment in DOOH is expected to
          reach $8 billion in 2025, up 10% from the previous year.
        </span>{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">
          Case in point is Coca-Cola's campaign in London, where interactive
          billboards responded to the weather and time of day, leading to a 20%
          increase in consumer engagement.
        </span>{" "}
        Modern digital billboards and interactive displays can display targeted
        ads based on weather, time of day or audience demographics. Programmatic
        DOOH advertising is becoming the standard and allows brands to optimize
        their campaigns in real-time, leading to better engagement and higher
        ROI.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">
        4. Interactivity and engagement on social media: communities first
      </h2>
      <p className="text-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Social media is transforming into platforms for deeper interaction.{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">
          According to a 2024 study by IAB Spain, users interact on average with
          4.9 social media platforms. Brands that encourage authentic engagement
          and create a space for users to share their experiences are seeing a
          30% increase in customer loyalty.
        </span>{" "}
        Live broadcasts, short videos and interactive formats such as polls and
        questions on Instagram Stories or TikTok Live are becoming the dominant
        ways for brands to communicate with customers.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">
        5. Neuromarketing: Understanding the consumer's mind
      </h2>
      <blockquote className="article-quote">
        Neuromarketing uses insights from neuroscience to analyse how consumers
        respond to marketing stimuli.{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">
          A study published in the Harvard Business Review showed that ads that
          activated the emotional centers of the brain were 23% more likely to
          be remembered by the brand.
        </span>{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">
          For example, an analysis of ads during the Super Bowl revealed that
          those with a high emotional charge had 40% higher effectiveness.
        </span>{" "}
        Neuromarketing analyzes the emotional responses, attention, and
        memorability of ads to help brands create more effective campaigns. The
        use of technologies such as eye-tracking, brainwave analysis and
        measuring stress and arousal levels allows marketers to tailor the
        visual and content elements of an ad to elicit the desired responses
        from the target audience. Neuromarketing thus becomes a key tool for
        improving advertising performance and building a deeper connection
        between brand and consumer.
      </blockquote>

      <h2 className="article-h2">
        6. Sustainability and ethics: brands with values lead the way
      </h2>
      <p className="text-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Consumers increasingly demand transparency and accountability from
        brands. Implementing sustainable and ethical practices in marketing
        campaigns not only strengthens brand reputation, but also resonates with
        the values of modern consumers, which can lead to higher engagement and
        loyalty.{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">
          According to a Kantar survey, 79% of consumers prefer brands that
          demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. Patagonia, known for its
          eco-friendly approach, saw a 30% increase in sales after launching an
          environmental campaign.
        </span>{" "}
        Eco-friendly packaging, carbon-neutral campaigns and support for social
        initiatives are becoming a common part of marketing strategies.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-foreground mb-8 leading-relaxed">
        Marketing in 2025 will be about a combination of technology,
        personalisation and a better understanding of consumer behaviour.
        Companies that can effectively implement these trends will gain a
        significant competitive advantage and successfully reach the modern
        customer.
