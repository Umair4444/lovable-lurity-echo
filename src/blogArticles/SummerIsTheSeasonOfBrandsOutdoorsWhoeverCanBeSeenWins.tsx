          People's habits change during the summer. They spend less time in
          front of computers and screens and more time outdoors. Less scrolling,
          more taking in real-life impulses. For brands, this means only one
          thing - if they don't want to disappear from the consumer's sight for
          a while, they should be present where people are naturally found:
          outdoors. And this is when outdoor advertising has its "best season".
        </p>

        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-6 my-8 italic text-foreground/80">
          Brands investing in the digital outdoors today are not just
          "advertising on the street". In fact, they're using one of the most
          effective and flexible formats available today - digital outdoor
          advertising, which today can change according to the habits and
          movements of the target audience, the weather or the time and
          location.

        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The summer months bring more movement of people in cities, more visits
          to shopping centres, cultural events and holiday locations. While
          online campaigns lose performance in the summer, outdoor digital
          advertising is gaining strength because it is present in the real
          world. And it actually has something to offer.

        <p className="font-semibold text-lg text-foreground mb-4">
          6 reasons why digital outdoor (in summer) works great:

              Visibility where the people are
            </span>{" "}
            - High footfall in shopping centres and public spaces means more
            intervention. Digital screens reach audiences directly - at the
            moment of decision and at the point of decision
          </li>
          <li className="text-foreground/90">
            <span className="font-semibold">Flexibility and speed</span> - Ad
            content can be adjusted in minutes: swap creative/video? Run a
            different offer when the temperature drops/rises? With digital
            outdoor this is no problem, you enter the platform and swap the
            visual or video
          </li>
          <li className="text-foreground/90">
            <span className="font-semibold">Context sells</span> - Ice cream
            brands promote when it's 30 degrees outside. Summer cinema offers
            are best contextualised in the evening. Outdoor digital advertising
            can be wonderfully responsive
          </li>
          <li className="text-foreground/90">
            <span className="font-semibold">Stronger memorability</span> -
            Movement, light, location - all work excellently and
            synergistically. According to research, digital outdoor has up to
            60% higher attention rates and 35% higher memorability than static
            formats

          Summer campaigns that work repeatedly in the summer

          Global and local brands such as Coca-Cola, Sprite, Costa Coffee and
          many others have been using seasonal outdoor advertising for years.
          The examples speak for themselves:

          <li className="text-foreground/90">
            The campaign used heat-activated billboards: when the temperature in
            selected Italian cities exceeded certain thresholds, digital screens
            launched new visuals specifically aimed at inviting people to
            freshen up

          <li className="text-foreground/90">
            The communication ran across the EU, the UK, Australia, Asia and
            other regions, in a variety of formats - from billboards to festival
            activations to promotional stands on the beach
