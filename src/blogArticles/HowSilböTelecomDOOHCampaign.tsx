          Silbö Telecom, a Spanish telecommunications provider offering
          high-quality mobile, internet and TV services, has partnered with the
          Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) as the main sponsor of the
          Spanish men's and women's national football teams.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          To extend the reach of this partnership, Silbö launched its first
          programmatic digital out-of-home (pDOOH) campaign, strategically
          targeting audiences in major Spanish cities.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Target</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          The aim of the campaign was to strengthen Silbö Telecom's connection
          with football fans across the country by raising the profile of its
          sponsorship and promoting its new unlimited data offer ahead of Euro
          2024. Leveraging the influence of DOOH, the campaign aimed to raise
          awareness, improve brand perception and inspire thinking.

          Strategy
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          MIO Group for mamerala to leverage the premium digital space of DOOH
          formats for precision targeting and programmatic delivery of messages
          to the target audience.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Digital screens were strategically activated in high traffic locations
          such as train and metro stations in Madrid, Barcelona, Málaga,
          Valencia, San Sebastian, Seville and Zaragoza. This positioning
          maximised visibility and repeat messaging in the target audience of
          commuters and urban dwellers, thus delivering the brand's message of
          providing a premium service.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">
          Creativity and communication
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          The Silbö ads communicated the brand's partnership with the Spanish
          national football teams while promoting the new unlimited data offer.
          The creative was tailored to each city to increase relevance and local
          response. For example, the ads in Seville read: "Experience the
          national team with unlimited data. Hotter than Seville in the summer."
          The visuals highlighted Silbö's affordable yet premium offering and
          captured the excitement and pride surrounding the upcoming tournament.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">Results</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
          In partnership with Broadsign and Happydemics, a brand reinforcement
          study was conducted to measure the impact of the campaign on key brand
          metrics including ad recall, brand image and brand awareness. A survey
          was conducted near screens in the study area, and the increase in
          familiarity was measured by comparing the responses of those who did
          not recall the ad and those who did.
