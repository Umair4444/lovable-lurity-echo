          In the ever-evolving landscape of advertising, 2024 has witnessed the
          rise of a captivating trend: Fake Out-of-Home (FOOH) advertising.
          Leveraging computer-generated imagery (CGI), brands are crafting
          hyper-realistic scenes that, while never physically existing,
          captivate audiences worldwide through digital platforms.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-10 mb-4">
          What is FOOH?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-foreground/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          FOOH involves creating digital simulations of out-of-home
          advertisements, such as billboards or installations, that are designed
          to appear real but exist solely in the virtual realm. These campaigns
          are primarily disseminated through social media, aiming to generate
          buzz and virality without the logistical constraints of traditional
          outdoor advertising.

            <span className="font-semibold">Cost-Effectiveness</span>: By
            eliminating the need for physical installations, brands can save on
            production and placement costs.
          </li>
          <li className="text-foreground/90">
            <span className="font-semibold">Viral Potential</span>: The surreal

          <li className="text-foreground/90">
            <span className="font-semibold">Creative Freedom</span>: Without
            physical limitations, brands can conceptualize and execute bold
            ideas that might be impractical in the real world.
