        Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH) advertising has come a long way. Once
        reserved for tech-savvy brands and pilot campaigns, it has evolved into
        a full-fledged, sophisticated media channel—strategically as well as
        performance-wise. As we look ahead to 2026, the next wave of DOOH
        transformation is on the horizon. So, what are the key trends reshaping
        the space?
      </p>

      <h3 className="article-h3">1. Retail Media & DOOH: Allies, Not Rivals</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Retail media is booming—and when combined with DOOH, it creates powerful
        last-mile advertising zones. In-store screens, entrance displays, smart
        windows—these aren't just new formats, they are perfectly timed and
        context-aware touchpoints.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8">
        <strong>Lurity</strong> already offers high-traffic zones in retail
        spaces—from parking lots and shopping malls to fitness centers and urban
        passageways.
      </p>

      <h3 className="article-h3">
        2. Programmatic DOOH: Measurability & Transparency
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Brands today don't just want visibility. They want data, KPIs, and ROI.
        DOOH is going programmatic, with growing expectations for
        accountability—just like in online campaigns.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Platforms like Place Exchange now offer attribution, frequency control,
        and cost-per-action metrics. It's time to stop viewing DOOH as
        "unmeasurable."
      </p>

      <h3 className="article-h3">3. Real-Time, Data-Driven Content</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        DOOH is no longer static or pre-produced. Dynamic content now adapts to
        weather, time of day, and even consumer behavior (anonymized).
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        McDonald's UK ran a campaign for cold drinks that only triggered when
        temperatures hit 22 °C. Smart, relevant, and highly effective—similar
        activations could be easily rolled out locally.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8">
        <strong>Lurity</strong> lets clients update visuals within minutes—no
        printing, no logistics, no delays. Rain in the morning? Sunshine in the
        afternoon? Your content adapts instantly.
      </p>

      <h3 className="article-h3">4. Context & Hyperlocal Targeting</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        DOOH reaches places digital can't—but it's even more powerful when it's
        locally relevant. Local events? Nearby partners? Specific time windows?
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Pet food brand <strong>Nulo</strong> in the U.S. launched a hyperlocal
        campaign within an 8 km radius of their retail locations—resulting in a
        40% lift in brand awareness.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Lurity gives clients the ability to choose locations and screen networks
        precisely according to their preferences — always in top spots with high
        foot traffic.
      </p>

      <h3 className="article-h3">
        5. AR, 3D & Interactive Formats: Redefining the Boundaries of DOOH
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Amazon Prime Video used 3D DOOH in New York and London to promote a
        series—creating massive organic reach just from people taking photos and
        sharing them online.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Industry events like ISE 2026 are expected to be all about AR signage
        and space interaction. DOOH is no longer just a surface—it's a gateway
        to immersive brand experiences.
      </p>

      <h3 className="article-h3">What Does This Mean for Brands?</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        DOOH isn't an "add-on" anymore. It's a{" "}
        <strong>strategic media channel</strong> in its own right—one that's
        becoming more{" "}
        <strong>professional, visible, safe, and less intrusive</strong> than
        many online formats.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Lurity</strong> aims to be more than just a provider—we want to
        be a{" "}
        <strong>
          creative partner shaping new DOOH formats and strategies
