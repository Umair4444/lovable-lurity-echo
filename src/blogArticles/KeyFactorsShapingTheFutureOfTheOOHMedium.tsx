        Last year was another strong year for OOH and the current year will be
        even more focused on growth and innovation. This media segment continues
        to evolve and consistently delivers exceptional creative, data-driven
        tactics and technology-driven results for advertisers.

      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-6 my-8 italic text-muted-foreground">
        With global OOH revenues expected to reach as much as US$41.82 billion
        in 2025 - and digital OOH (DOOH) expected to grow by 8.44% to reach
        US$22 billion - further expansion is on the horizon, driven in large
        part by increased investment and the growing adoption of programmatic
        OOH (prOOH).
      </blockquote>

      <p className="mb-4">
        As OOH evolves, its direction has several key priorities. These include
        leveraging econometrics to maximize ROI, aligning DOOH with media
        networks to improve the path to purchase, and leveraging artificial
        intelligence to increase efficiency and creativity. These priorities
        will ensure that OOH remains a key player in the advertising ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The year 2025 is defined by these 6 major trends that will shape the
        future of OOH:

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">

        <li>continued growth of prOOH</li>
        <li>data-driven OOH will become the anchor of omnichannel campaigns</li>

      </ul>

      <h3 className="article-h3">
        1. A network of real connections creating micromoments
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In a world saturated with digital interactions, consumers crave
        authentic connections and spend a lot of time away from home. They seek
        depth, authenticity and sensory richness in their experiences.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        They want to "engage" in a real way and find experiences that connect
        them to their surroundings. Accenture has called this "social rewilding"
        - an effort to recreate social connections in the real world and to
        channel technology in moments that bring people joy and well-being.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In 2024, according to Kantar's research, 48% of people frequently spent
        time outdoors, 47% socialized with friends, and 46.9% shopped at
        physical grocery stores. OOH advertising puts brands at the centre of
        this because the medium is well 'implementable' into people's everyday
        lives.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Using audience-centric planning and real-time data in OOH to deliver
        highly contextual and targeted messaging is mainstream this year. This
        approach allows brands to create campaigns that act as personalized
        one-to-one connections.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Personalization in OOH is changing the way brands engage audiences -
        from real-time, such as location, weather and time of day, to
        dynamically tailoring OOH campaigns to their environment.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        This enables highly relevant and impactful messages that bridge the gap
        between broad reach and personal response. For example, ads for
        children's sunscreen on digital OOH during sunny weather placed where
        parents are more likely to see them. Similarly, a protein coffee
        promotion that runs on commuter routes and programmatically displays to
        people who are more likely to go to the gym.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
        81% of consumers appreciate brands that surprise and delight them with
        personalised messages
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8 font-semibold">
        48% of Gen Z and Millennials recommend products they see in OOH ads
      </p>

      <h3 className="article-h3">2. Continued growth of prOOH</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        PrOOH will continue its rapid growth as more and more brands take
        advantage of its accuracy, flexibility and real-time capabilities across
        a wide range of applications.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        By combining the flexibility of digital platforms with the unparalleled
        reach of OOH, programmatic enables advertisers to refine their media
        plans and buy and optimize ad placements in real-time and in line with
        the audience. This precision enables brands to deliver highly relevant
        messages to targeted audiences at the right time and in the right place.
      </p>
      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-6 my-8 italic text-muted-foreground">
        In the UK, spending on PrOOH will continue to grow, estimated to
        increase from £86.8 million in 2024 to £105 million in 2025. We will see
        more advertisers using PrOOH, with an estimated 36% of media plans
        including PrOOH and an average increase in spend on PrOOH campaigns over
        the next 18 months of +29%.
      </blockquote>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
        90% of marketers agree that prOOH offers the most opportunities for
        innovation, up 9 percentage points from the previous year, outpacing
        social media (83%) and display (81%).

        3. Data-driven OOH will become the anchor of omnichannel campaigns
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        OOH, which is the link between physical and digital touchpoints, will
        play a key role in multichannel marketing strategies in 2025.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        OOH acts as a link between consumers' digital footprints and their
        experiences, delivering holistic campaigns. By creating connections
        between screens, OOH empowers brands in consumers' everyday lives and
        connects campaigns across mobile, social and in-store. Linking between
        screens increases engagement and improves brand memorability.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        By syncing OOH with digital channels such as social media and mobile
        ads, marketers can achieve a cohesive message that resonates across
        touchpoints.
      </p>
      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-primary pl-6 my-8 italic text-muted-foreground">
        Campaign effectiveness is up to 23% higher when the same content is
        activated across digital OOH and social media

      <h3 className="article-h3">
        4. Supporting sustainable marketing strategies with OOH
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Sustainability is becoming a top priority for consumers and businesses,
        and OOH advertising continues to take steps to reduce its environmental
        impact.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Sustainable practices such as DOOH powered by green energy and recycled
        conventional poster materials are now commonplace. Compared to all other
        measured media, OOH accounts for 3.3% of total advertising energy
        consumption and &lt;3.5% of the UK's total carbon footprint.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Consumers increasingly value brands that prioritise sustainability, and
        OOH can meet this expectation while maintaining the scale and impact
        needed to influence public perception.
      </p>

      <h3 className="article-h3">5. OOH credibility builds consumer trust</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In an era of digital misinformation, OOH is proven to build trust. It
        remains a stable and trusted medium for authentic brand communication,
        and unlike digital platforms where content credibility is often
        questioned, OOH offers a physical presence that reinforces trust in the
        real world.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
        62% of respondents say that trust is an important factor for them when
        deciding to work with a brand.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
        60% are more likely than before to doubt the authenticity of online

      <h3 className="article-h3">6. Connecting experience and OOH</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        OOH and experiential channels will increasingly converge, blurring the
        line between static media and live brand experiences. As consumers crave
        immersive, memorable interactions with brands, OOH will evolve to
        include more experiential elements, turning physical spaces into
        interactive scenes where audiences can actively engage with content.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We see physical spaces re-imagined as experiential scenes that combine
        OOH creativity with interactivity. From game billboards to immersive art
        installations, experiential OOH campaigns invite audiences to engage
        directly with the brand. Tactile, sensory-driven experiences not only
        increase brand memorability, but also foster emotional connections that
        make the consumer feel part of the story, and OOH becomes a leader in
        creating meaningful interactions.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
        41% of respondents said the most enjoyable experience of the previous
        week was the physical experience

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
        74% of consumers believe experiential activations improve their brand
        perception
