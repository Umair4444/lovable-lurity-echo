        <li>Personalisation improves user experience</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Let's take a closer look at each of these trends and the data underlying
        them.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">
        1. Artificial intelligence increases efficiency and effectiveness
      </h2>

      <p>
        Advances in artificial intelligence are having a big impact on
        marketing. According to HubSpot's State of Marketing Report 2024, 64% of
        marketers are already using AI and automation. Additionally, consultancy
        Gartner predicts that 80% of advanced creative roles in marketing will
        be tasked with using GenAI to improve their marketing activities by
        2026.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two areas in which AI often appears in marketing workflows are content
        production and marketing analytics.
      </p>

      <h3 className="article-h3">GenAI for content production</h3>

      <p>
        Many marketers use generative AI (GenAI) at various stages of content
        creation, estimating that they save approximately three hours of work
        per piece of content, with 84% of those using AI reporting greater
        efficiency in content creation, 82% reporting that they produce
        significantly more content, and 56% reporting an increase in content
        performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can use GenAI tools like ChatGPT or Google Gemini to generate
        content ideas, create briefs and outlines, draft content, or even write
        complete pieces.
      </p>

      <h3 className="article-h3">
        Using artificial intelligence for marketing analytics
      </h3>

      <p>
        Data-driven marketing isn't a new trend, but the way marketers get their
        data is changing thanks to artificial intelligence. According to The
        Work Innovation Lab's 2023 report, The State of AI at Work, 30% of
        workers are already using AI to analyze data, and 62% of workers want to
        use AI to analyze data.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the power of AI driving the analytics, you can learn about your
        target audience, identify trends, predict behavior, and optimize your
        marketing campaigns faster and more accurately than you could without
        the help of AI.
      </p>

      <p>
        Strengthen your marketing analytics skills with the Meta Marketing
        Analytics Professional certification. You'll learn how to collect and
        analyze marketing data and how to turn your insights into actionable
        strategies.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">
        2. Short video content drives social strategy
      </h2>

      <p>
        As marketers increasingly target digital generations, they're meeting
        them where they are: scrolling through short videos on TikTok, YouTube
        and Instagram. According to HubSpot, short-form video is the content
        type with the highest return on investment (ROI) and is poised to see
        the most growth in 2025. 53% of marketers plan to increase their
        investment in TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">3. UGC increases brand awareness</h2>

      <p>
        User-generated content (UGC) is any type of content that users post
        about your product on their social media profiles. The content itself
        may be similar to the type of content you see influencers or affiliate
        partners post, but unlike those posts, brands don't directly partner
        with users to sponsor or create content. Rather, it's more word-of-mouth
        marketing, where users create content and share it with their audience,
        and businesses can then leverage that content through tactics like
        social sharing or giveaways.
      </p>

      <p>
        Traditional influencer marketing continues to have its place in
        marketing strategy, but marketers are also increasingly relying on UGC
        as a cost-effective way to promote brand awareness in a way that feels
        organic to the typical viewer. According to Gartner, more than 80% of
        consumers believe UGC improves product discovery, brand trust and
        experience.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">
        4. The power of community and a real brand foster consumer trust
      </h2>

      <p>
        According to Gartner, authenticity is the third highest value that
        American consumers identify with, and nurturing a brand's true voice
        will become increasingly important as AI-generated content becomes more
        prevalent in the online space.
      </p>

      <p>
        The modern marketer's response: lean into emotional connections with
        community-building efforts. A 2024 report from marketing platform TINT
        found that 70% of marketers agree that building community is key to
        customer retention and that 82% of consumers are more likely to purchase
        new products from a company with an engaging online community.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">5. Quality editorial content persists</h2>

      <p>
        Marketers will continue to invest in editorial content, such as blog
        posts and podcasts, to generate engagement, drive conversions and
        promote thought leadership. According to HubSpot, 82% of marketers
        surveyed plan to increase or maintain investment in podcasts and audio
        content, and 92% plan to increase or maintain investment in blog posts.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">
        6. Case studies support brand recognition and sales opportunities
      </h2>

      <p>
        More traditional content marketing, such as case studies, is typically
        used to increase brand recognition and support lead generation,
        especially for B2B marketing. In 2024, case studies will continue to
        appear in marketing strategies. HubSpot found that 26% of marketing
        teams are already using case studies in their content marketing
        strategy, and 87% of marketers plan to increase or maintain their
        investment in case studies.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">
        7. Changes in search engines are shifting SEO strategies
      </h2>

      <p>
        Gartner predicts that AI-based improvements to popular search engines
        will reduce organic search traffic to brand websites by 50% by 2028.
        Despite the changing landscape, HubSpot reports that 92% of marketers
        plan to increase or maintain their investment in SEO.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to evolving historical strategies, SEO teams are
        increasingly expanding into video, image and, in some cases, audio
        search content, with the goal of prioritizing a delightful customer
        experience while leveraging all aspects of the latest Google and Bing
        developments.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">
        8. Artificial intelligence chatbots expand the possibilities of
        conversation
      </h2>

      <p>
        Chatbots and virtual assistants provide consumers with quality answers
        to common or easy-to-answer questions. With advances in AI and natural
        language processing (NLP) technologies, it's becoming easier and easier
        for marketers to program and use these tools to increase efficiency
        without disrupting customer satisfaction. According to HubSpot, 58% of
        marketers plan to increase their investment in chatbots.
      </p>

      <h2 className="article-h2">
        9. Personalisation improves user experience
      </h2>

      <p>
        AI-mediated personalised experiences lead to repeat purchases according
        to 96% of marketers and increase sales according to 94%. Product
        recommendations based on machine learning or immersive experiences, such
        as augmented reality (AR) features that allow users to "browse" physical
        products in their space, leverage consumers' individual preferences to
        unlock data-driven purchase decisions and increase customer
        satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is still a new trend in digital marketing. Although 73% of
        marketers agree that personalization is important, only 35% feel that
        their brand offers a personalized user experience.
      </p>

      <h3 className="article-h3">
        Privacy policy and privacy protection are changing targeting strategies
      </h3>

      <p>
        Alongside the interest in personalisation, digital marketers are acutely
        aware of the changes in data collection and privacy that may change the
        way they learn about their audience. As Apple and Google phase out
        third-party cookies, businesses are exploring first-party data
        collection methods.
