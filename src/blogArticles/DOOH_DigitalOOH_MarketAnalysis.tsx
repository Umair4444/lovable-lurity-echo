          Let's look together at the facts that literally play into the hands of
          this dynamically developing medium.
        </p>

        {/* Bullet points */}
        <ul className="space-y-4 mb-8 list-disc pl-6 text-muted-foreground">
          <li>
            DOOH is a very cost-effective way to reach a wide range of audiences
            and its use is growing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Increasing urbanization and infrastructure development across the
            globe is expected to continue to drive market growth during this
            forecast period. Rising spending on outdoor advertising by various
            industries is again boosting the market expansion, as the
            effectiveness of the medium also lies in rotating more ads on a
            single screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            DOOH is also increasingly popular because it helps to increase brand
            awareness and is a handy (not only) complementary channel for brand
            communication.
          </li>
          <li>
            As we've shown many times before with research studies from this
            actively growing industry, people are spending more time away from
            their offices and homes, and OOH allows companies to reach large
            numbers of people regularly and relatively quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the expansion of the OOH
            market: during the pandemic, the decline in demand for digital
            signage solutions in key industries has significantly affected the
            development of digital OOH solutions. In addition, the lack of a
            competent workforce during the pandemic hampered the expansion of
            the DOOH market.

          Key global trends shaping the DOOH market

              Transit accounts for a significant share of the digital OOH
              advertising market
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            The demand for digital content and information relevant to riders
            has resulted in interactive advertising through various modes of
            advertising such as kiosks, billboards, and bulletin boards,
            contributing to a large share of the growth in transit media
            revenue.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a result, there has been a change in consumer behavior in terms
            of customer interaction across all means of transport, enabling
            companies to strategically develop their brands in the minds of
            customers. In the next three years, this will lead to an outflow of
            potential customers away from traditional media.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transport is the most important segment, as public transport is the
            preferred mode of transport for a large part of the population in
            Europe and Asia Pacific due to a mature and dense public transport
            infrastructure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Airports are an attractive environment for advertising, especially
            for high-end and luxury products, among many modes of transport.
            Airports are under increasing pressure to find new techniques to
            generate revenue. By converting static displays such as posters into
            digital presentations, airports can offer several sponsors instead
            of one. This will significantly increase revenue. In addition, by
            involving advertising partners, airports can share the costs of
            upgrading to new technologies.
          </li>
          <li>
            After airports, railways have also seen a significant increase in
            the incidence of DOOH: the growing demand for 'smart' railway
            stations in emerging economies is increasing the demand for DOOH.
          </li>

            Asia and the Pacific, in particular, has seen significant growth, as
            it has the largest population of any region. With the increase in
            urban population and increased purchasing power, they are thus

          </li>

            Consumers in Asia Pacific and other emerging countries are following

            shifting from traditional media channels to attractive digital
            media. This, in turn, is leading to the growth of the DOOH
            advertising market across the region as Western counterparts,
            especially the North American region, have a significant presence in
            the market.

          <li>
            Transportation is the most dominant segment, as public
            transportation is the primary choice for a significant portion of

            public transportation infrastructure.

          consists of several large outdoor advertising and media companies
          operating in multiple markets, as well as smaller local companies
          operating a limited number of structures in one or a few local
